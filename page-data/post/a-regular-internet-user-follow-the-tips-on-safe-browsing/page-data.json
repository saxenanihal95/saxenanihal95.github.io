It can largely protect a user from falling into the trap of cybercriminals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you must install a well-reputed and secure web browser and use the same to safeguard your surfing journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular web browsers have come with great protection against phishing or malware. A prominent web browser can also help you to lessen your exposure to various websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check Your Security Settings:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being proactive will help you to prevent or lessen the attack of malware on your system. Hence, what should you do now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the settings of your browser and alter some features, as per your preferences. However, changing settings could create some inconveniences in your browsing journey but safety always comes first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, it is better to shut off features like password storage or autofill. Thus, you can prevent hackers to get access to sensitive data that could otherwise incur great losses to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, you should invest time to fill usernames and passwords of various accounts of your own.

However, it could alleviate some of your surfing enjoyment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, turning “cookies” off enhances your privacy online. Unfortunately, lots of websites would not serve you when you disable cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other features in this regard include JavaScript, plug-ins, and so on. Now, it is up to you, which features you would like to enable or disable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take Help Of Password Manager:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You already know you should disable the autofill option. Then, there must be a feasible option to save your credentials of various accounts, is not it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, you can use a reputed password manager. It can memorize the usernames and passwords for websites and fill the same when you visit the respective login page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, it is also imperative to set unique passwords for every website. Thus, you can stop hackers to access multiple websites with the same password through automation, in case of password theft.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ninth-2-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"A Regular Internet User?
