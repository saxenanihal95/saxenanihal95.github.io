Moreover, the owners of iOS devices\ncannot alter the code on their own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, it becomes tougher for\ncybercriminals to search for security loopholes on these devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Android devices\ndepend upon an open-source code. That means Android users can modify the\noperating systems of their devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can be the result? Excessive\nmodification can develop security loopholes in the security of Android devices.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose, a new device gets\nmanufactured with an alternation to the Android OS with code vulnerability. What\nwould be the result? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers would spot it easily and it\ncould wreak havoc to the device security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can very easily realize\nthe situation!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is More? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know cybercriminals often prefer\nto target Android? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is because a large number of\ndevices nowadays run on Android OS. Moreover, the popularity of this operating\nsystem is on the rise around the globe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why it becomes a lucrative\ntarget to hackers. As a result, Android devices are more susceptible to viruses\nas well as malware- the result of the attacks of cybercriminals. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It Is Not The Entire Story! </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, do not reach the conclusion now!\nCertainly, iOS seems to be more secure than Android. Nonetheless, it is not\nentirely impossible for hackers to attack iPads or iPhones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the solution then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are an Android or iOS\ndevice owner, you must know about potential security threats. The severity of\nviruses and malware is increasing. Therefore, you must stay careful and aware\nto save your devices from unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a frequent downloader of applications\nfrom third-party app stores? Think twice before doing that. It could threat your\ndevice’s security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to do then</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest way is to\ndownload and install apps from reliable sources like the Apple App Store and Google\nPlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beware Of Social Engineering Attacks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Such attacks are all about duping\nusers to get their login credentials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Unauthorized access of personal\naccounts and data if attackers successfully get the information</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social engineering attacks do not\ndepend upon the type of mobile OS. Both Android and iOS may be equally susceptible\nto such phishing attacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/android-199225_1280-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"Android Vs. iOS Security: Which Is Better?\" class=\"wp-image-779\" srcset=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/android-199225_1280-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/android-199225_1280-300x188.jpg 300w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/android-199225_1280-768x480.jpg 768w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/android-199225_1280.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Android Vs. iOS Security: Which Is Better?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is About Hardware Integration?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximum security of an Android device\nrelies on its hardware. In simple words, some manufacturers are better in ensuring\nthe correct operation of Android’s built-in security functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope <strong>android vs. Ios </strong>was\ninsightful for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, whichever device you are using,\ndo not forget to practice security measures. </p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Introduction Do you wonder about android vs. Ios security?
