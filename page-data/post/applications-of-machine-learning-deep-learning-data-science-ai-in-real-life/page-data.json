They track unusual behaviour of people like standing motionless for a long time, stumbling, or napping on benches etc. The system can thus give an alert to human attendants, which can ultimately help to avoid mishaps. And when such activities are reported and counted to be true, they help to improve the surveillance services. This happens with machine learning doing its job at the backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some real-life examples of Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial intelligence and there are many more.
