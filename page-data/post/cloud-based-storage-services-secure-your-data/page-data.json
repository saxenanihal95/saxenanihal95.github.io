You can access your stored information anywhere, anytime in the presence of the Internet. And so, it is no denying that such services will last for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/01/26/09/14/hand-3108175_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud-Based Storage Services: Secure Your Data\"/><figcaption>Cloud-Based Storage Services: Secure Your Data</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely, they have streamlined the data accessing facility a lot. However, some questions on security are still prevalent. We do not know whether anyone else can still be able to access the stored data or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, some precautions from your part can enhance safety. And it is not rocket science, you can strengthen the confidentiality by following the tips below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips To Secure Your Data In A Cloud-Based Storage Service</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Back-Up Your Data:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day we deal with loads of data, is not it? Hence, it is critical to take care of them. The first step here is to create <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en-in/articles/data-backup/\">back-ups of data</a>, essential for your personal and professional life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take electronic copies in this regard to get access to the same, as per the needs. Remember, the original copy can be lost or corrupted at any time. Hence, do not avoid creating back-ups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from creating soft copies, it is also recommended to store data in any external physical device, such as an external hard disk drive. As a result, you can access your information in the absence of the Internet or when there is a poor connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Not Store Sensitive Information In Cloud-Based Storage Services:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every individual has some confidential or sensitive information. And you must not take any chance with their privacy, is not it? The incidents of identity theft are rising with time. Hence, you do not need to store any private information on the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, you do not need such information daily, right? Hence, choose to store only frequently-used information when it comes to cloud storage, which is available 24/7. Do you think it is urgent to store some private information on the cloud? Then, take the help of encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Data Encryption Facility In Cloud-Based Storage Services:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, many cloud-based storage services are available, but you need to look for one that has data encryption capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform must encrypt your data locally, and thus you can ensure an added security for your information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, encrypted data would need the decryption key to get access to the stored information. Thus, you can protect your data from authorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data security will further strengthen if the respective platform uses encryption throughout the uploading and downloading data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, encryption, as well as decryption, may slow down the process of syncing your files with the cloud-based storage. But, if you want to go that extra mile to protect your data, you must go through this waiting time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Set A Strong Password:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We often see this line when it comes to the question of security. However, some people may still take it lightly when it comes to cloud platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want strong protection for your storage against any malicious attack by hackers, then choose a hard-to-guess password always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, you should keep on changing it from time to time to maintain the protection. On the other hand, do not forget to use two-step verification, whenever available.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/02/07/55/cloud-2570253_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud-Based Storage Services: Secure Your Data\"/><figcaption>Cloud-Based Storage Services: Secure Your Data</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the steps and ensure the safety of your data on cloud-based storage service. Moreover, it is now essential to use <a href=\"https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-choose-great-security-product-thats-right-you\">anti-virus </a>as well as anti-spy software to keep malware at bay.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Introduction With the advent of cloud-based storage services, many things got easier.
