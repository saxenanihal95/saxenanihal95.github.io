It is nothing but a malicious code that can spread from one host to another by self-replicating itself. In fact, users do not have any knowledge about their presence in their devices, if they are not aware of the signs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A virus enters or attacks a device to complete various types of malicious activities. It can corrupt or delete sensitive files of the victim’s device. Moreover, taking access of the system is the common nature of viruses. Cybercriminals then exploit such information to gain a massive profit. Naturally, the consequences can be extremely devastating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main goal of a computer virus is to enter a vulnerable system and take the access of admin control to steal confidential information. Hackers trick users with different types of traps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some Common Types Of Viruses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer viruses come in various forms. However, some of the most common types of infections are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Boot Sector Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The name itself is self -explanatory. Such types of virus attack the master boot record (MBR) and spread via the removable media (CDs, DVs, or Blu-Ray Disks) most of the time. Unfortunately, it is not that easy to remove such viruses and it calls for formatting the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Direct Action Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Such type of viruses remains inactive on a system as long as the file containing the same gets executed. Hence, the takeaway is you must not download or open any unsolicited attachment in your system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resident Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Such type of viruses attacks computer memory. In fact, it is both difficult to trace as well as eliminate such malicious programs from the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Polymorphic Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This virus is very smart, as it can change its core pattern during self-replication. And that is why it is tough to detect them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Overwrite Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These viruses are highly infectious. They can spread via email messages. Moreover, it can delete all the infectious files. That means the consequences can be extremely harmful to an organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spacefiller Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being also called “Cavity Virus,” the spacefiller species can fill up the vacant spaces in the computer codes. Strangely, it does not pose any threats to the files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>File Infector Virus:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Also called “Parasitic Virus,” the file infector virus is attached to program files (or executable files). Many times, we need to download files online, so it is a safe practice to have the help of virus detector software.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Viruses: Introduction And Some Common Types\" class=\"wp-image-867\" srcset=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eighth-3-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Computer Viruses: Introduction And Some Common Types</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you detect a slow performance of your computer without any known reason, then it could be due to a virus attack. Moreover, the automatic appearance of pop-ups is also a prime sign of viruses. Sometimes, a virus attack can enable programs to start self-running. Moreover, you can also come across automatic duplication or multiplication of files. Furthermore, if you find out any strange files or apps in your system, a virus could be responsible.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Introduction Are you looking for information on different types of viruses?
