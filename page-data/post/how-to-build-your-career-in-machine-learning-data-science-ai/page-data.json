There are many people who struggle with concepts in statistics as much as I do, as it proves that you can be a data scientist without being a statistician.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-learn-python\">3) Learn Python:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is my personal choice for machine learning as it provides various tools for machine learning like pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc and python language is very easy to learn as it is very similar to the pseudocode we use to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-join-kaggle\">4) Join Kaggle:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The slogan of Kaggle,”Home of Data Science” which is a very awesome slogan chosen by them to describe their website. There are various competitions in Kaggle which will help you to increase your knowledge and will also help you to build connection with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-youtube\">5) Youtube:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best sources for learners is youtube, there are so many channels you can find which are focused on AI, Data Science, Machine Learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6) Online Courses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many courses paid and unpaid courses which you can online on websites like <a href=\"http://coursera.org\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com\">Udemy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\">Udacity</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the points which I think will be useful in building your career in one of the fields(AI, Data Science, Machine Learning).
