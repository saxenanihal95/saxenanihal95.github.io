In Addition, it will give notifications to your phone when any movement is detected at the sensor installed zone. The whole setup works over the internet so it’s limitless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Components Used In Making This Project</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Hardware</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Espressif ESP8266 ESP-01</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a Wi-Fi module manufactured by Espressif with ESP8266 integrated chip. It is one of the cheapest Wi-Fi modules used in multiple IoT projects.&nbsp; This board operates on 3.3V dc.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PIR Motion Sensor</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It is basically used to detect movements with approx 10m from the sensor. However, the actual detection range is between 5m to 12m. PIR Motion Sensor is developed by a pyroelectric sensor. It is very beneficial for various projects </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>ESP8266 Serial Adaptor</strong><strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It is one of the most important components in every hardware hacker’s toolbox. The ESP8266 was specifically designed to use with Wi-Fi adapters. We need this device to gain 3.3V TTL into a Wi-Fi connection </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Softwar</strong>e</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Arduino IDE</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It is an open-source software developed by Arduino. It simplifies to write codes and upload it to the board.&nbsp; In addition, it runs on all major platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its platform is based on java and other open-source software.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>IFTTT Maker Service</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It enhances our DIY projects by integrating IFTTT services. Various applets can be created in order to receive web requests. If you really want to make own custom applets then do check the IFTTT platform </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The\nbasic Working Principle</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Firstly we need to\nconnect the <strong>PIR Motion Sensor</strong> to one\nof the <strong>GPIO pins</strong> of <strong>Espressif ESP8266 ESP-01.</strong></li><li>Whenever any movements\nget detected by the PIR Motion Sensor. The output of the PIR changes its states\nwhich will immediately get detected by the <strong>Espressif\nESP8266 ESP-01</strong> controller chip.</li><li>We need to program the\nEspressif ESP8266 ESP-01 in such a way that it generates HTTP GET requests to\nthe IFTTT webhooks applets.</li><li>As\nsoon as the <strong>ESP8266 ESP-01</strong>\ncontroller chip generates an HTTP GET request then it will reflect\nnotifications on your mobile device.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Pin Configurations&nbsp; And Diagrams</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Circuit Diagrams</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common steps</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>All Gnd need to be connected together.</li><li>Give 3.3Volts to the VCC pin of ESP8266 ESP-01 and PIR HC-SR501.</li><li>Connect GPIO 0 pin of ESP8266 ESP-01 to the OUT pin of PIR HC-SR501.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Creation Of IFTTT Applet</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>All you need to create an\nIFTTT account by visiting their website. www.ifttt.com.</li><li>Log in with your\ncredentials and create your custom Applet in IFTTT.</li><li>After that, download and\ninstall IFTTT app from Google store or app store to your mobile device.</li><li>Lastly, after downloading\nlogin with your credentials and give all the permission the app needs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step1:&nbsp; </strong>Select the create\noption from the drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n2:&nbsp; </strong>Next\nclick on <strong>+This</strong> button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; </strong>Now you need to search\nfor webhooks, and click on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>\nNow from “choose trigger” just tap on the “Receive a web request”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n5:</strong> Type a name for the event, I entered <strong>“iot_Motion_sensor”.</strong> now click on\nCreate Trigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n6:</strong> Now simply tap on <strong>+That</strong> button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step7:</strong>\nIt’s the time to choose active service, search notification and click on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n8:</strong> Now choose which options you want. There\nare 2 types of notifications simple and rich. However, I choose a simple one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n9:</strong> Write the message need want when motion\nis detected. It is customizable you can give time also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step\n10:</strong> Tap on the Finish button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> You are done creating an applet successfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Receiving\nHTTP GET URL request</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step1:</strong> Click on your\nprofile pic and choose My services from drop down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Webhooks</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on\nDocumentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> follow the things mentioned in the screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The detailed code using C/C++</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"cpp\" data-enlighter-theme=\"\" data-enlighter-highlight=\"\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"\" data-enlighter-lineoffset=\"\" data-enlighter-title=\"\" data-enlighter-group=\"\">#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h>\n\n#include &lt;ESP8266HTTPClient.h>\n\nconst char * ssid = “ ** ** * ”; //Your WiFI ssid\n\nconst char * password = “ ** ** * ”; //Your WiFi password\n\nboolean PIRstate; //variable to store PIR state\n\nboolean lastPIRstate = HIGH;\n\nint PIR = 0; //PIR connected to GPIO 0\n\nvoid setup() {\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)\n\n  {\n\n    delay(1000);\n\n  }\n\n  pinMode(PIR, INPUT); //digitalWrite(PIR, LOW);\n\n  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);\n\n  delay(30000);\n\n}\n\nvoid loop()\n\n{\n\n  PIRstate = digitalRead(PIR); //HIGH when motion detected, else LOW\n\n  if (PIRstate != lastPIRstate) //Checking if there is any motion\n\n  {\n\n    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);\n\n    delay(100);\n\n    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);\n\n    if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) //Check WiFi connection status\n\n    {\n\n      HTTPClient http; //Declare an object of class HTTPClient\n\n      http.begin(“paste the link from ifttt”); //Specify request destination\n\n      http.GET(); //Send the request\n\n      http.end(); //Close connection\n\n    }\n\n    lastPIRstate = PIRstate;\n\n  }\n\n}</pre>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Time to Upload and test</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Upload the code to ESP8266 ESP-01 using ESP8266 Serial Adaptor</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give 30 seconds to calibrate PIR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you will start receiving a notification when motion is detected.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In this DIY project, we will learn how to design a motion sensor.
