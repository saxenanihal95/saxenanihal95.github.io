Nowadays, many cybercriminals use this technique to make the computer user bound to pay an amount to get the access back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, criminals ask for a ransom after locking the device and get access to the user data. Clearly, it is one of the dangerous cybersecurity threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the question arises <strong>how to prevent&nbsp;ransomware </strong>in a system. Do not worry, the next part is one the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Strategies To Prevent Ransomware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think preventing ransomware is like a hard nut to crack? It is not actually! Let us talk about some simple-to-follow techniques that will help you to stay safe from this threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refrain Yourself From Clicking Unreliable Links:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Malicious links are an integral part of not only in ransomware but also in many cyberattacks. Therefore, you must remain conscious when it comes to clicking an unknown link. First, verify the sender and then make your decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, clicking on an unverified link can infect the entire system. Later, ransomware can encrypt the data pieces of the respective computer. Moreover, locking of the system is also done in this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may think paying ransom can be the only solution. However, it is not the case. There is no guarantee of getting back the access even after the payment. Hence, prevention and awareness are the only solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stay Away From Unknown Email Attachment:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Always verify an email address before opening an attachment sourced from it. If needed, contact that person and confirm about the same if you receive an unexpected email attachment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the attachment must be genuine. For instance, do not open anything that needs you to enable macros for viewing. Otherwise, an infected attachment can make the malicious macro run in the system. As a result, malware can access and take over your system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Always Download From A Verified Website:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, it has become an almost regular task for an internet surfer to download different things from websites. However, it can also include the risk of ransomware download without any knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, what might be the solution?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never download any media file or software from an unknown website. First, find out the list of trusted websites in your interested area and then opt for your option. Moreover, reputed and reliable websites come with different features of trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not worry- you can recognize some of them instantly. After landing on any website, search for ‘https.’ Moreover, a ‘lock’ symbol must also be there in the respective address bar. At least these two features make a website secure for downloading anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to downloading any application on your mobile phone, always use the recommended app store only. Never think of jailbreaking of your device at least if you want to ensure your device’s security from any malware including ransomware.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1-1024x456.jpg\" alt=\"Ransomware: Introduction And How To Prevent? \" class=\"wp-image-814\" srcset=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1-1024x456.jpg 1024w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1-300x134.jpg 300w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1-768x342.jpg 768w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1-1536x684.jpg 1536w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Third-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Ransomware: Introduction And How To Prevent?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Never attach any unknown USB device in your system.
