However, spyware is still there through which\nattackers are harming victims. It is nothing but a software piece, which keeps\ntrack of victims browsing activities. Moreover, it spies on keystrokes and\nrecords the same. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, you can easily realize how\ndangerous spyware can be for your security. Even it can gather almost all sorts\nof data, including sensitive and personal ones. Therefore, it is a must to stay\nsafe from spyware attacks to ensure secure computing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips To Protect Your System From Spyware</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Always Disable AutoRun Feature:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you an avid computer user? Then,\nyou must know what an auto-run feature is. If this feature is enabled, then\nsome predetermined system actions will take place. Some of the media types that\ncome with AutoRun include different USB storage devices, CDs, DVDs, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, AutoRun enables malware\n(spyware, worms, etc) to get installed in a system without any user\nintervention. Hence, disable this feature always. The manual running of\nprograms is the best idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beware Of Downloading Free Adware:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you fond of downloading free\nsoftware? Then, you must be very careful. Definitely, many of such software can\nbe user-friendly. However, some of them could be malicious to your system. Many\ntimes it is not possible to detect whether free adware is safe or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, free software can seem\nsecure but it can attach malware, including spyware. Therefore, you need to\nresearch a lot before downloading free adware.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Be Cautious Of Pop-Up Ads:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have come across pop-up ads a\nlot in your browsing journey. However, you should ignore such ads from next\ntime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, do not respond to them\never. Some pop-up ads can come with the “Close” or “Cancel” button. Never click\non them since they may be traps. You just need to right-click on the window’s\nborder (at the top). Now, select “Close.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the popup blocker\nfeature in your web browser. However, some websites may need pop-ups for\nexecuting some operations. That is why you can choose pop-us to turn OFF for\nreliable websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Anti-Spyware Software: </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Advanced malware pieces have become\nflexible, invisible, severer, and resilient. That means a basic antivirus\nprogram cannot provide strong protection against such damaging threats. If\npossible, take the help of anti-spyware software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search for a program that will save\nyour system from all sorts of malware (both common &amp; uncommon). Moreover,\nit must feature sandbox protection and powerful web protection feature. Thus,\nyou can expect to stay safe from malicious websites and potential frauds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-2-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Spyware Prevention: Some Useful Tips To Protect Your System\" class=\"wp-image-790\" srcset=\"http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-2-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.psycoderblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-2-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Spyware Prevention: Some Useful Tips To Protect Your System</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you got some valuable insights\ninto spyware prevention.
