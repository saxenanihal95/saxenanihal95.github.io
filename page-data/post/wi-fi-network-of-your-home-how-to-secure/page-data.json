Yes? Then, keep reading the post. Undoubtedly, Wi-Fi or Wireless Networking has streamlined the life of internet users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, one can surf the internet on any device in any corner of the house without depending on cables. All credit goes to a Wi-Fi connection. However, we need to consider the flip side of the coin as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/04/08/56/wifi-1371030_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"Wi-Fi Network Of Your Home: How To Secure? \"/><figcaption>Wi-Fi Network Of Your Home: How To Secure?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The conventional wired network makes it almost impossible for any third party to get access to your bandwidth. On the contrary, the Wi-Fi network is susceptible to unauthorized access that means other people can use your internet from nearby proximity. This activity is called piggybacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Should You Protect Your Wi-Fi?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you are familiar with what piggybacking is! It comes with loads of downsides. First, it will definitely affect your internet bill a lot. You would need to pay increased charge especially when it comes to per byte payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, piggybacking also lowers the speed of Internet access. It is because a third party (s) is sharing your internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, unauthorized access also poses security threats. As a result, hackers may attack your system and access the confidential files of your system. That means your own Wi-Fi network can become vulnerable to your system security if it is not secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How To Secure The Wi-Fi Network?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Visit Your Router Settings Page: The First Step To Protect Wi-Fi Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is essential to know the process of accessing the settings page of the wireless router. Just you need to type “192.168.1.1” into the web browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it is time to entering the user name as well as the password for your router without any mistake. Remember, the credentials are different for every router. That is why you need to check the user manual first. You can also visit the manufacturer’s website of your router.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It Is Time For Password Creation: Next Step To Protect Wi-Fi Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you logged into the router? Now, it is time for creating a strong (hard to guess) password by changing the default one. Thus, you can enhance the security of your router and prevents unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also visit the Administration settings on the settings page of your router. You will find default values there in the form of “password” or “admin.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Change The Network’s SSID Name:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also change the SSID or the network name of your router. However, it is not going to increase the security of your network but others will know about your network. Nonetheless, refrain from using your name, address or any other personally identifiable information in the place of SSID.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take The Help Of Network Encryption:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to make your Wi-Fi network free from unauthorized access? Then, encryption of your signals is a must. Nowadays, various encryption techniques are available, such as WPA, WPA2, and WEP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas WEP is the basic one, WPA2 comes as the most secure option. However, the latter one is not suitable for all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Filtering Of MAC Addresses:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add an additional layer of security, it is time for adding the MAC addresses of each of the devices to the settings of the respective wireless router. As a result, you can ensure only some particular devices (Wi-Fi enabled) can access your Wi-Fi network.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/10/16/16/laptop-2055521_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"Wi-Fi Network Of Your Home: How To Secure? \"/><figcaption>Wi-Fi Network Of Your Home: How To Secure?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the aforementioned steps and strengthen the security of your Wi-Fi network. Moreover, do not forget to alleviate your wireless signal’s range. Also, it is essential to update the router’s firmware.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Introduction Do you want to safeguard your Wi-Fi network? Yes? Then, keep reading the post.
